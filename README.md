# Semantic Web Projet 2021

## RDF data management and processing

The Semantic Web project is a large and long practical exercise that consists in integrating all the pieces that have been seen during the first sessions into a consolidated Web application. To make sure you can advance sufficiently fast to cover everything, you are allowed to work by pair.
